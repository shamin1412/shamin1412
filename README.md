## ✨ About Me  
Hi! I'm **Shamin**, an MSBA graduate with a passion for creating **clean, automated data workflows** and uncovering insights that genuinely help businesses run better.  

With a foundation in **Accounting & Finance**, I love blending numbers, clarity, and storytelling to solve real problems — especially in the **banking and financial services** world.

I aim to build things that:  
- ✔ reduce manual work  
- ✔ simplify decision-making  
- ✔ look clean and intentional  
- ✔ and actually make someone say “ohhh that’s useful”

## 📌 Highlighted Projects  
Here’s a small taste of what I enjoy working on:

### 🎬 **Super Bowl Ad Engagement Analysis**  
A deep dive into how major brands performed during the Super Bowl using pre–post engagement data.  
Clean insights, beautiful visuals, and a narrative-style notebook.  
*Located in this repo.*

## 🎯 What I’m Building Right Now  
- More analytically rich portfolio projects  
- Clean, automated data workflows  
- A stronger presence in the analytics + finance space

## 🌱 A Bit of My Personality  
I like things that are:  
- clean ✨  
- minimal but not boring  
- structured but still expressive  
- and most importantly… useful  

Whether it's a dashboard, notebook, or automation script — I try to build things that feel organized and intentional.
